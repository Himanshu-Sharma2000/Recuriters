The aim of RECURTER is to provide simple and effective hiring solutions for organisations in retail, hospitality, and other industries. It's straightforward: we aid in pipeline development and manager candidate screening. We do this with a pleasant user interface and an AI recruitment assistant who has time to handle all the tasks that managers and recruiters are unable to complete.
